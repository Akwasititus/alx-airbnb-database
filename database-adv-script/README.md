# Airbnb Clone Database â€“ SQL Joins Practice

This project is a simplified **Airbnb Clone Database Schema** for practicing SQL queries, especially different types of JOINs.  

## ðŸ“‚ Schema Overview

The database contains the following tables:

- **users**  
  Stores user information (guests & hosts).

- **listings**  
  Represents properties created by hosts.

- **bookings**  
  Stores booking details between users and listings.

- **reviews**  
  Stores user reviews for listings.

### ERD Structure
users (1) â”€â”€â”€< listings
users (1) â”€â”€â”€< bookings
users (1) â”€â”€â”€< reviews
listings (1) â”€â”€â”€< bookings
listings (1) â”€â”€â”€< reviews

## ðŸ›  SQL Joins Examples

### 1. INNER JOIN â€“ Bookings with Users
Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made them.
```sql
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_amount,
    b.status,
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email
FROM bookings b
INNER JOIN users u
    ON b.user_id = u.user_id;
2. LEFT JOIN â€“ Listings with Reviews
Retrieve all listings and their reviews, including listings with no reviews.

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    l.listing_id,
    l.title,
    l.location,
    r.review_id,
    r.rating,
    r.comment,
    r.user_id
FROM listings l
LEFT JOIN reviews r
    ON l.listing_id = r.listing_id;
3. FULL OUTER JOIN â€“ Users and Bookings
Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if a user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.

PostgreSQL / SQL Server:
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    b.booking_id,
    b.listing_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date
FROM users u
FULL OUTER JOIN bookings b
    ON u.user_id = b.user_id;
MySQL (simulate FULL OUTER JOIN with UNION):
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    b.booking_id,
    b.listing_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN bookings b
    ON u.user_id = b.user_id

UNION

SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    b.booking_id,
    b.listing_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date
FROM users u
RIGHT JOIN bookings b
    ON u.user_id = b.user_id;
ðŸš€ How to Use
Run the schema file:

sh
Copy code
mysql -u root -p < schema.sql
Insert some test data into each table.

Run the SQL queries from above to see JOIN results.

ðŸ“š Learning Objectives
Understand different types of SQL JOINs:

INNER JOIN â†’ Matching rows only

LEFT JOIN â†’ All from the left table, matched or not

FULL OUTER JOIN â†’ All rows from both tables, matched or not

Practice writing clean SQL queries

Work with relational data in a real-world schema
