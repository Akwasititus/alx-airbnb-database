# Optimization Report â€“ Bookings Query

## ðŸ“Œ Initial Query (from performance.sql)

```sql
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_amount AS payment_amount,
    b.status AS payment_status,
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    u.phone_number,
    l.listing_id,
    l.title AS property_title,
    l.location AS property_location,
    l.price AS property_price,
    l.host_id AS host_user_id
FROM bookings b
INNER JOIN users u 
    ON b.user_id = u.user_id
INNER JOIN listings l 
    ON b.listing_id = l.listing_id
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC;



ðŸ“Š Performance Analysis with EXPLAIN

When running:

EXPLAIN
SELECT ...

Potential Issues:

Full Table Scans

If no indexes exist on bookings.user_id, bookings.listing_id, or bookings.created_at, the database may scan the entire table.

Sorting Overhead

ORDER BY b.created_at DESC can be costly without an index on created_at.

Unnecessary Data Loads

If some columns (like phone_number) are not always needed, fetching them increases I/O.

âœ… Refactored Query for Optimization
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_amount AS payment_amount,
    b.status AS payment_status,
    u.user_id,
    CONCAT(u.first_name, ' ', u.last_name) AS user_full_name,
    u.email,
    l.listing_id,
    l.title AS property_title,
    l.location AS property_location,
    l.price AS property_price
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u 
    ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN listings l 
    ON b.listing_id = l.listing_id
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC;

Improvements:

Removed u.phone_number (optional, reduces I/O if not always required).

Combined first and last name into user_full_name (reduces post-processing at application level).

Maintained essential joins only (no extra tables like reviews added unnecessarily).

âš¡ Recommended Indexes

Add the following indexes to speed up JOINs and filtering:

-- Bookings: optimize joins and ordering
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user ON bookings(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_listing ON bookings(listing_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_created_at ON bookings(created_at);

-- Listings: optimize property joins
CREATE INDEX idx_listings_id ON listings(listing_id);

-- Users: optimize joins
CREATE INDEX idx_users_id ON users(user_id);

ðŸš€ Expected Benefits

Faster JOIN execution since lookups use indexes instead of full scans.

Faster sorting of bookings due to index on created_at.

Reduced memory and I/O footprint by selecting only necessary columns.

ðŸ“š Next Steps

Run EXPLAIN again after adding indexes.

Compare query cost (rows examined, execution time) before vs after.

Continuously monitor queries with the slow query log (MySQL) or pg_stat_statements (Postgres).
